Game Description: Notakto (probably involves human vs.human mode and human vs. AI mode)

Game rules: Notakto is a tic-tac-toe variant, also known as neutral or impartial tic-tac-toe. It is played across three 3 x 3 boards: Board A, board B and board C. When all of the boards have a three-in-a-row of Xs, the game is over, and the person who made the last move loses. Unlike tic-tac-toe, there will always be a player who wins every game of Notakto. Notakto is an unbiased game in which the allowed moves are determined only by the current state of the game, not by which player is taking their turn. It's a disjunctive game when played across numerous boards. Notakto is a game that is played on a set of empty three-by-three boards. Then each player takes turns placing an X in a vacant area on the board(s) (a space not occupied by an X already on the board). If a three-in-a-row appears on a board, it is considered dead and cannot be used. When a player makes three consecutive threes and there are no more boards to play on, that player is eliminated.
